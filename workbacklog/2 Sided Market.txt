Need a website for Staretgic Market
look at 
http://appdevinc.com/


--------------------
2 sided market
1 repo = skill category (payments, addressing, events registration, )
skill = folder (serverless function, each folder a variant .. versioned)
requisition - issue -- posted, priced, tagged)
pricing can be single payment, subscription or both (requires manintenance)

also 
1 repo = agent -- comilation of skills -- with machine to orchestrate sequence

it is context -- narrow -- so might work -- private member only market

for developers, paid interns, collaboration, skill development, references

need a social site linked to github -- across repos (skills and agents)

---
tight reqs -- common api, common set of architectural decisions -- shows how to mobilize a workforce around 1 unified goal
