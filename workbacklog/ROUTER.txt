-----------------------------------
express.Router


Use the express.Router class to create modular, mountable route handlers. A Router instance is a complete middleware and routing system; for this reason, it is often referred to as a “mini-app”.

The following example creates a router as a module, loads a middleware function in it, defines some routes, and mounts the router module on a path in the main app.

Create a router file named birds.js in the app directory, with the following content:

var express = require('express')
var router = express.Router()

// middleware that is specific to this router
router.use(function timeLog (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Time: ', Date.now())
  next()
})

// define the home page route
router.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Birds home page')
})

// define the about route
router.get('/about', function (req, res) {
  res.send('About birds')
})


module.exports = router
---------
Then, load the router module in the app:

var birds = require('./birds')

// ...

app.use('/birds', birds)

The app will now be able to handle requests to /birds and /birds/about, as well as call the timeLog middleware function that is specific to the route.
