TOP POINT -- virtual agents capable of multistep interactions is difficult -- but following a sequence with predictive analysis is what is needed. A tree structure -- where each 'transaction set' is well defined (JSON) -- and the platform simply uses NLU/NLP to complete open information until all points are captured -- and the next best action ios triggered -- a search of the internet, a retrieval of a web page or recording of infomration

On top of this -- banter needs to be handled well -- including interupts to the cycle of interactions ---

3. NLU point of view

NLU is a very difficult problem that begins to look similar to artificial general intelligence (AGI)?—?not just perception but cognition. Large labs like Facebook’s are actively researching these issues of reasoning, attention and memory. For example, answering questions based on facts, counting, creating lists, coreference (two expressions referring to the same thing), understanding time, inheritance of properties, size and positional reasoning are some of the reasoning tasks that Facebook has set out to tackle on a limited dataset. We have a very long way to go.

BUT IF WE SET CONTEXT -- operate within private networks -- things begin to change

Smaller companies like Ozlo are bringing in the scope of the problem, starting narrow with a domain like food and places. But even in constrained problem space, one must make complex decisions. What reviews are trustworthy? Even if we can accomplish the kind of reasoning suggested by Facebook, we’ll just be scratching the surface of “knowledge.” Training data for natural language models will be by definition, user generated?—?and what is a fact?
