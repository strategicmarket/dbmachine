The team at Nordstrom built Hello Retail with one scenario in mind: a merchant adding a product to their store.

When a product is added to the store, two things need to occur. A photographer needs to take a photo of the product. After this, customers should see the new product with the new photo in the product catalog.

The Hello Retail project solves this problem with events. The three major events in this scenario are:

Register Photographer
New Product
New Photo
