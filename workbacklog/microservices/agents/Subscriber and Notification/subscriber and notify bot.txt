when new content is added we want to fire off notifications to subscribers

def notify_subscribers
      client = Twilio::REST::Client.new
 
      Subscriber.find_each do |subscriber|
            client.messages.create(
                from: "YOUR_TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER",
                to: subscriber.phone_number,
                body: self.fact
              )
      end
end
