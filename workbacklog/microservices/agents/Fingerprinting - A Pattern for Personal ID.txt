data fingerprinting

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will be a new regulation in EU which will come into effect in May 2018. This new regulation applies to those organizations, including those outside EU, which collect and process personal data. It aims to give more control to individuals over usage of their personal data.

Right to forget - Under the new GDPR, organizations around the world must not only protect personal data but also forget personal data on request from individuals.

When a customer requests that all his or her personal data be deleted, then an organisation needs to identify all the documents where the customer's personal data reside. This code pattern addresses the need to identify the personal data from the provided documents. Also, we will see how to assign a confidence score for the personal data that indicates the confidence level in identifying an individual uniquely as part of the code pattern.

uses NLU and REGEX to process and extract entities

Viewer passes input text to personal data extractor.
Personal data extractor passes text to NLU.
Personal data is extracted from input text. NLU uses custom model to provide the response.
Personal data extractor passes NLU output to regex component.
Regex component uses the regular expressions provided in configuration to extract personal data, which is then augmented to the NLU output.
Augmented personal data is passed to scorer component.
Scorer component uses the configuration to come up with a overall document score; result is passed back to the personal data extractor component.
This data is then passed to the viewer component.
