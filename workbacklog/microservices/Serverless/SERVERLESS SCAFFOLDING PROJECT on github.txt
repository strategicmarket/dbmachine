This is a scaffold for Serverless projects using AWS and the Serverless Framework. It's intended to be a base for creating other projects, with all the tools you usually don't add until the very end -- when it's too late. To that end, this includes:

test runner: py.test
documentation: compiled from RST with Sphinx to HTML and PDF
CI/CD: with CircleCI since that's what we use
pep8, lint, flake8 checks
badges on this page for docs, tests, etc.
(need some serverless code at this point)
multiple stages: local, feature-branch, dev, qa, prod
508 testing
security testing
tox
The application isn't terribly important but ideally should include common use cases, so here are a few features I can think of:

api: allowing GET, POST
uploading media: to S3, perhaps with presigned URL
uploading form data: to DynamoDB
authentication: with Cognito, so we get social media auth
modern web ui: with Angular2+ served from S3
