The novel idea of Strategic Machines is that cognitive applications can be delivered in a short cycle at a lower economic price point by leveraging microservices. The term ‘cognitive’ has become synonymous with ‘artificial intelligence’, and as a result, many static or highly predictable tasks that can be handled through pure functions have deployed to complex ai platforms. Complexity and costs mount. Organizations are reluctant to adopt. Opportunity is lost.

Strategic Machines is dedicated to the delivery of winsome Brand interactions through chat. By meeting customers in any channel and delivering hybrid solutions through smart virtual agents, we help our clients gain a competitive edge in their respective markets. Strategic Machines
