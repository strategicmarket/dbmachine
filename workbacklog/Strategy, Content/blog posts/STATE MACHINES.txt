https://www.npmjs.com/package/xstate


-------------------------

I am thinking about this incorrectly -- go to the state machine to determine the next action to execute -- that is it. The state machine is used purely for orchestration. The functions that are identified for execution and pulled in by handlers are supplied via configs and microservices 

so machine.getState()  needs to return an identifier with options to execute -- thats it

Then it is passed to a handler which does that -- some kind of uniform api

-------------

xstate returns an object with the values set -- could be associated with a single function that is registered on the platform or as a cloud function --- and executes

--------
 need to have some kind of meter as well
