Excellent work. Delighted to be doing this with each of you

1. novel, experimental - 
> ESSENTIALLY -  do one thing and do it eceptionally well
> you calbrate to the work based on your interests and skills
> permits someone to become expert on 1 component of a system -- it becomes your domain for all refactoring and maintenance going forward?
> design for dev success -- all environments, tools, test data and architectural decisions packages together -- imagine every web site being delivered like this

also novel with respect to the messaging process. This is about providing customers with the ability to deploy cognitive apps -- quickly and efficiently -- 

both side a journey of discovery -- i am glad you're working with me on this


2. f2f meeting probably won't happen until June -- need beta version of webmachine ready before we meet in person

3. your deliverable has to include
> code - well commented
> docs -- think of readme file
> test data 

when someone stands up and navigates the paths of webmachine, it has to work right out of the box


3. Test DBs and Production DBs will move to their own server at some point. Should be able to happen with config file change

4. Thinking about using slack as the UI for customers to register for networks, receive analytical insights, and other functions as well
> but a web ui still needed long term
> the functions built for the webui can obviously be used for the 'messaging ui' -- future refactoring effort but our code needs to be well componentized and portable

5 static site generation -- update from Daniel

Just note that we may be swapping out our docs site for a new capability publiched by vue -- I will be looking for a content manager to work by the outcome and join our team FYI. 

For example, want to load these workitems to github and begin using what Juan built once refactoring completed

As well as load our dev docs, codix and other items
