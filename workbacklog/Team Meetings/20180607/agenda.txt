-- big issue is having 
* a 'dashboard' to monitor outcomes and 
* a console to change up the agent interactions? Right now it is very custom -- tied to machine learning process of watson and the config of agents in a microservice

We will solve this as we go along ....

ie - prepackaged recipes for common interactions -- deploy to watson etc
- just like prepackaged microservices that can be deployed or customized --- should a microservice be designed to consume a spreadsheet of interactions -- or can we set up vscode as the platform for someone to use as their command console?

we bring the user into the devops process with us -- just like the developer on github?

or give the user their own github repo -- with all their interactions -- we retrieve real time from their by a microservice?

> next issue -- configure using slack /slash commands
