## Test Data Generator

Note that this package exports a function called 'responses'

require('/datagenerator').responses triggers the function in index.js, executing the two functions contained in this package. The first drops the collection, and the second imports a csv file and loads a mongo collection

Excellent process for seeding test data, or creating a channel for users to load data
