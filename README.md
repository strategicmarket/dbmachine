Test data generator for the Strategic Machines set of platforms

## Getting Set Up

Getting the app running on your local machine takes only a few steps:

1. clone the project - `git clone https://github.com/strategicmarket/dbmachine.git
2. install its dependencies - `npm install`
3. Update configuration parameters
4. start the app - npm run dev

This will start the webpack server for the frontend and nodejs

The code base is isomorphic, with key configuration data shared between client and server functions
